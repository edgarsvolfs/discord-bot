This project is a Discord bot built with discord.py that powers a small credits-based economy, moderation tools, and a Blackjack mini-game. User balances are stored in a simple JSON dictionary inside a .txt file.
A lightweight “economy + games + moderation” bot that can be run locally or hosted on platforms like Replit with minimal setup.
